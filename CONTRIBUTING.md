We're really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition. 👏

## Instructions

These steps will guide you through contributing to this project:

- Fork the repo
- Clone it and install dependencies

		git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/collection-fns
		yarn

Keep in mind that after running `yarn` the git repo is reset. So a good way to cope with this is to have a copy of the folder to push the changes, and the other to try them.

Make and commit your changes. Make sure the commands yarn run build and yarn run test:prod are working.
